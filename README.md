# Scheduling-Algorithm-Project
Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Shortest-Job First Scheduling

1. The program will ask for the number of process
2. After entering a number, enter the following input respectively:

Process Name:
Arrival Time:
Clock Cycle:

The program will loop these inputs until the last process is reached.

3. After entering the last input, the program will first run the Preemptive Scheduling, followed by the Non-Preemptive Scheduling.
 
4. Both Scheduling will display the switching of process and Average Turnaround time respectively.
